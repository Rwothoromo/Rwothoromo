### Hi there 👋

Clearly we both have an interest in ✨ _code_ ✨ #BuildingTheFuture 😄

I code for fun. I code for bread. I code to grow.
I look at programming languages as tools to achieve a given project's goals. In that regard, I work with Python, Kotlin, Java, PHP, JavaScript and of course, HTML/CSS. You can check out what I use for code [here](https://rwothoromo.wordpress.com/2020/05/29/uses/).

Beyond Geek, I occassionally write when inspired on my [site](https://rwothoromo.wordpress.com) _(you might love the poetry)_. You can also find some of my works on [medium](https://medium.com/@rwothoromo).

I love comedy, sci-fi, chess, good music and movies. I recommend [CGMeetUp](https://www.youtube.com/user/CGMeetUp) if you love animations and [DUST](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7sDT8jZ76VLV1u__krUutA) for that awesome futuristic sci-fi stuff; both are on YouTube.

You and I can be friends, workmates, connections, etc. So, why not connect!?
